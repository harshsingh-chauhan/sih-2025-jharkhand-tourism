## Project Information

### Project Title

**JharkhandYatra** - Smart Digital Platform for Eco & Cultural Tourism in Jharkhand

---

### Project Description

**Short Description:**
JharkhandYatra is a digital tourism platform that connects travelers with authentic local experiences in Jharkhand—from tribal homestays and verified local guides to handcrafted artisan products—making eco and cultural tourism accessible, organized, and community-empowering.

**Long Description:**

Jharkhand is blessed with extraordinary natural beauty, rich tribal heritage, historical landmarks, and eco-tourism destinations like Netarhat, Patratu, Betla National Park, Hundru Falls, and Deoghar. However, despite this vast potential, the state's tourism industry remains underdeveloped due to limited digital infrastructure, poor promotional outreach, and unorganized travel services.

Tourists currently struggle to find reliable information about authentic local experiences, safe homestays, trustworthy guides, and genuine tribal handicrafts. Meanwhile, local communities—artisans, tribal families offering homestays, and knowledgeable local guides—remain largely excluded from the tourism economy due to lack of digital presence.

JharkhandYatra addresses this gap by creating a centralized digital marketplace that serves as a bridge between tourists seeking authentic experiences and local communities offering genuine services. The platform enables tourists to discover, compare, and book verified homestays and guides while purchasing authentic tribal handicrafts directly from artisans.

The platform differentiates itself through community-first design, ensuring that local service providers can easily list their offerings, receive bookings, and build their reputation through reviews. By digitizing these traditionally informal services, JharkhandYatra aims to increase tourism revenue flowing directly to local communities while giving tourists the confidence to explore off-the-beaten-path destinations.

Expected impact includes increased tourist footfall to lesser-known destinations, higher income for local communities, preservation of tribal crafts and cultural practices, and positioning Jharkhand as a premier eco-cultural tourism destination in India.

### Color Usage Guidelines

**Do's:**
- ✅ Use primary (terracotta) for main CTAs and navigation active states
- ✅ Use secondary (amber) for pricing, ratings, and promotional badges
- ✅ Use accent (green) for eco-tourism tags and availability indicators
- ✅ Use semantic colors consistently across all feedback messages
- ✅ Pair vibrant colors with neutral backgrounds for breathing room
- ✅ Use tribal patterns sparingly as decorative accents, not backgrounds

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Don't use primary and secondary colors adjacent without neutral separation
- ❌ Don't use vibrant colors for large background areas (overwhelming)
- ❌ Don't mix more than 2 brand colors in a single component
- ❌ Don't use patterns behind text content
- ❌ Don't override semantic color meanings (green ≠ error)

### Color Accessibility Matrix

| Text Color | Background | Contrast Ratio | WCAG Level | Use Case |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| base-content | base-100 | 12.5:1 | AAA | Body text |

### Dark Mode Considerations

**Dark Theme Colors:**
```css
@plugin "daisyui/theme" {
  name: "jharkhandyatra-dark";
  prefersdark: true;
  color-scheme: "dark";
  
  --color-base-100: oklch(18% 0.02 50);
  --color-base-200: oklch(22% 0.025 50);
  --color-base-300: oklch(28% 0.03 50);
  --color-base-content: oklch(92% 0.015 80);
  
  --color-primary: oklch(62% 0.18 25);
  --color-secondary: oklch(78% 0.14 70);
  --color-accent: oklch(58% 0.14 145);
}
```

**Dark Mode Strategy:** Auto (system preference) with manual toggle option

[AI Suggestion: For MVP, implement light theme only. Dark mode can be added as a post-MVP enhancement.]

---

## UI/UX Design System

### Design Principles

- **Consistency:** Reuse components and patterns throughout. Same action = same appearance.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum. Keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first approach. Touch-friendly on mobile, information-dense on desktop.
- **Modularity:** Atomic design methodology. Build complex UIs from simple, tested components.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Respectful representation of tribal art and culture. Avoid appropriation.
